Cohesion PHP Framework
======================

The primary objective for creating this framework is to provide a simple framework to help developers create good clean PHP code. It forces developers to write code that follows many common software development principles such as the ones defined in [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) and [GRASP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)).

Cohesion is more than just a Framework, it's a development guideline that tries to enforce best practices to improve mantainability.
